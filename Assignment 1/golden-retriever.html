Golden Retrievers always rank high among the most popular breeds in the United States. These loyal, sociable dogs are excellent with children and families, and excel at obedience training and therapy work. Developed in the 1860s to be swimmers &amp; retrievers, these pups love doing both of those things! Goldens are fairly large in size and have a medium-high energy level. They are known as loveable, confident and eager to please companions and do well in many environments, from apartments to larger living spaces. <a href="https://www.puppyspot.com/puppies-for-sale/breed/golden-retriever/overview">Learn more &gt;</a>

Golden Retrievers always rank high among the most popular breeds in the United States. These loyal, sociable dogs are excellent with children and families, and excel at obedience training and therapy work. Developed in the 1860s to be swimmers &amp; retrievers, these pups love doing both of those things! Goldens are fairly large in size and have a medium-high energy level. They are known as loveable, confident and eager to please companions and do well in many environments, from apartments to larger living spaces. <a href="https://www.puppyspot.com/puppies-for-sale/breed/golden-retriever/overview">Learn more &gt;</a>
